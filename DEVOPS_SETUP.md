# DevOps setup — production deploy pipeline

`.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` runs **only when a `vX.Y.Z` release tag is pushed** — merging
a PR to `main` by itself deploys nothing. Cutting a release is a deliberate, separate step:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

That pushes tag then runs:

1. Reads the version back out of the tag itself (`resolve-version`) — the tag *is* the version, nothing
   to compute or bump
2. Pushes DB migrations + deploys all Supabase Edge Functions (`supabase-deploy`)
3. Builds and promotes the PWA on Vercel (`deploy-vercel`) — **skipped entirely if step 2 fails**
4. Posts a summary to the Actions run page (`summarize`)

This is separate from `apps/web/public/changelog.json`, which `.githooks/post-commit` still bumps
locally on every commit — that file tracks the running list of unreleased changes shown in the app's
update banner. It does NOT decide what gets deployed; only pushing a tag does. `apps/web/scripts/gen-
version.mjs` prefers an exact release tag at the built commit over changelog.json's version field when
both exist, so the version a user actually sees in the app matches the tag that shipped it.

Picking the next tag: check `apps/web/public/changelog.json`'s `[0].version` for the auto-bumped
suggestion, or just increment the last tag yourself — either is fine, since nothing enforces the tag
match changelog.json exactly.

## Required GitHub Secrets

Add these under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets** on the repo (not an
environment — this workflow doesn't use one).

| Secret | Used by | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` | `supabase-deploy` | [supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens](https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens) → Generate new token. This is a *personal* access token for the CLI, not a project key. |
| `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` | `supabase-deploy`, `deploy-vercel` (build), `summarize` (optional push) | Supabase dashboard → your project → **Settings → General → Reference ID** (the `abcdefghijklmnop` in `https://abcdefghijklmnop.supabase.co`). |
| `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` | `supabase-deploy` | The database password you set when the project was created. Lost it? Dashboard → **Settings → Database → Reset database password**. |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | `summarize` (optional, only if the push-notification step is enabled — see below) | Dashboard → **Settings → API → Project API keys → `service_role`**. This key bypasses RLS — GitHub secrets are encrypted at rest and masked in logs, but treat it with the same care as a database superuser password. |
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | `deploy-vercel` | [vercel.com/account/tokens](https://vercel.com/account/tokens) → Create token. |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | `deploy-vercel` | Run `vercel link` once locally from `apps/web` (or the repo root — see below) with the Vercel CLI; it writes `.vercel/project.json` containing both `orgId` and `projectId`. Do **not** commit that file — it's already covered by the root `.env`-style gitignore rules... actually it isn't, so add `.vercel` to `.gitignore` if you run this locally. |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | `deploy-vercel` | Same `.vercel/project.json` as above, or Vercel dashboard → project → **Settings → General → Project ID**. |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | `deploy-vercel` (build) | `https://<SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID>.supabase.co` — same project as above. |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | `deploy-vercel` (build) | Dashboard → **Settings → API → Project API keys → `anon` `public`**. Safe to ship to the frontend by design (that's what RLS is for) — but keep it in Secrets rather than committed anyway, since it's still project-specific. |
| `VITE_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` | `deploy-vercel` (build) | The public half of the keypair Web Push uses — see `apps/web/.env.local` / `supabase/functions/.env` in local dev for the dev keypair. **Generate a separate, real keypair for production** (`npx web-push generate-vapid-keys`); never reuse the dev one. The private half goes to Supabase (below), never to Vercel/GitHub. |

The VAPID **private** key isn't in this table because it's not a GitHub secret at all — it's a
Supabase Edge Function secret. Set it directly against the linked project once:

```bash
supabase secrets set VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=... VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=... VAPID_SUBJECT="mailto:you@yourdomain.com" \
  --project-ref <SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID>
```

(and `RESEND_API_KEY` **and** `RESEND_FROM_ADDRESS` the same way, if you want `notify-shop-status`'s
student emails to actually send — also not GitHub secrets, for the same reason. Both are required, not
just `RESEND_API_KEY`: `notify-shop-status/index.ts` skips sending (with a `console.warn`, nothing louder)
if either is missing. `RESEND_FROM_ADDRESS` must be a sender address on a domain verified in that Resend
account, e.g. `"Cite Shop <notifications@yourdomain.com>"`.)

## Required: point the DB webhook / cron job at this project

Migration `00014_parameterize_notification_endpoints.sql` reads the `notify-shop-status` trigger's and
`inventory-alerts-hourly` cron job's target URL/key from a table (`public.app_settings`), not a
hardcoded value — the migration itself never contains a real value at all; only `seed.sql` (local-dev
only, never pushed to a real project) does. Without this step, `db push` succeeds but both
notifications silently no-op (the trigger/cron function checks for `null` and skips, rather than
failing the actual `UPDATE`/cron run). Run this **once**, directly against the hosted project (Dashboard
→ SQL Editor, or `supabase db execute --linked` from a machine with it linked) — substituting the real
project ref and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` value from the table above (both are meant to be public, same
as shipping the anon key to the frontend, so no extra secret-handling concern here):

```sql
insert into public.app_settings (key, value) values
  ('functions_url', 'https://<SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID>.supabase.co/functions/v1'),
  ('anon_key', '<VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY>')
on conflict (key) do update set value = excluded.value;
```

Re-run it if this project's anon key is ever rotated.

## Required: configure production Auth redirect URLs

`supabase/config.toml`'s `[auth]` section (`site_url = "http://localhost:5173"`,
`additional_redirect_urls = [...]`, and the custom `magic_link` template pointing at
`supabase/templates/otp.html`) only applies to the **local** `supabase start` stack — none of it is
pushed to the hosted project by `db push` or `functions deploy`. A brand-new Supabase project's Auth
Site URL defaults to `http://localhost:3000`, and if it's never changed, GoTrue silently ignores any
`emailRedirectTo`/`redirectTo` the app passes (used by `PinPadModal.tsx`'s "Forgot PIN?" flow,
`GlobalLogin.tsx`, and `ProfileSettingsCard.tsx`'s OTP flows) and falls back to that default — so
users clicking a magic-link/reset-PIN email get bounced to `localhost` instead of the real app, and
they get Supabase's generic default email template instead of the custom one-time-code one.

Set this **once**, directly on the hosted project — Dashboard → **Authentication → URL Configuration**
(no CLI equivalent is wired into this pipeline):

- **Site URL**: the real production webapp URL (e.g. `https://<your-production-domain>`).
- **Redirect URLs**: add the same URL with a wildcard, e.g. `https://<your-production-domain>/**`, so
  every route (`/reset-pin`, `/reset-password`, etc.) an email might redirect to is covered.

If you also want production to send the custom one-time-code template instead of Supabase's generic
"click to sign in" default, copy `supabase/templates/otp.html`'s content into Dashboard → **Authentication
→ Email Templates → Magic Link** by hand — that piece of `config.toml` isn't synced to hosted either.

## Optional: push notification on deploy

The last step in `summarize` pings all admins via `dispatch-push` when a deploy succeeds. It's off by
default (a failed announcement push shouldn't be able to make a deploy look broken, so it's gated
behind a repo *variable*, not just left unconditional). To turn it on:

**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables tab** → add `ENABLE_DEPLOY_PUSH_NOTIFICATION` = `true`.

This also requires `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (table above) to be set, since `dispatch-push` only
allows a role-wide broadcast when called with that key.

## One-time Vercel dashboard setting

This is a pnpm monorepo — the actual frontend lives in `apps/web`, not the repo root. In the Vercel
project's dashboard: **Settings → General → Root Directory** → set to `apps/web`. The workflow runs
`vercel pull` / `vercel build` / `vercel deploy` from the repo root and relies entirely on this setting
to find the right app; without it, Vercel will try to build the monorepo root and fail (or build the
wrong thing).

## Branch protection

Production now only deploys off a pushed `vX.Y.Z` tag, not off `main` directly — so tagging is the
real production gate, not merging. Still require PRs into `main` (repo **Settings → Branches → Add
branch protection rule**) so nothing ships to a release tag without review, and consider a **Tag
protection rule** (**Settings → Tags** → pattern `v*`) restricting who can push tags matching that
pattern, since anyone who can push one triggers a real production deploy.

## Sanity checklist before the first real run

- [ ] All 9 secrets in the table above are set.
- [ ] Vercel project's Root Directory is `apps/web`.
- [ ] Production Supabase project has its own VAPID keypair and (if wanted) `RESEND_API_KEY` **and
      `RESEND_FROM_ADDRESS`** set via `supabase secrets set` — **not** copied from local dev. Both are
      required together; student emails silently no-op if either is missing.
- [ ] `public.app_settings` has `functions_url`/`anon_key` rows for this project (see "Required: point
      the DB webhook / cron job at this project" above) — without it, shop-status and inventory alert
      notifications silently never fire.
- [ ] Production Supabase project's Auth **Site URL**/**Redirect URLs** are set to the real production
      domain, not left at the `http://localhost:3000` default (see "Required: configure production Auth
      redirect URLs" above) — without it, magic-link/reset-PIN emails redirect users to `localhost`.
- [ ] `main` has branch protection requiring PRs.
- [ ] A tag protection rule restricts who can push `v*` tags, since that's what actually triggers a
      production deploy now.
- [ ] `ENABLE_DEPLOY_PUSH_NOTIFICATION` left unset (or `false`) until you've actually verified a manual
      `dispatch-push` call against production works — the first real deploy is not the moment to find
      out it doesn't.
